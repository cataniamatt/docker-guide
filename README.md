# Testing Docker and Docker containers
In this project a Docker image will be built and then used to create multiple containers of a simple Flask web app.

## Python virtual environment
Go to the project directory and execute the following command to create a Python virtual environment:

```
python3 -m venv venv
```
Once the virtual environment is created, activate it using:
```
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Project dependencies
All the project dependencies can be installed on the host machine or in the virtual environment using:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
